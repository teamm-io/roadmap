# Teamm public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official Teamm public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/teamm-io/projects/1)

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [GitHub public feedback discussions](https://github.com/orgs/teamm-io/discussions/51). 

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **released** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed.


Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows: 

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.
